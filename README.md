# Juggle Counter (PoC)

Web app that counts football juggles using the device camera and MediaPipe Object Detection with a custom TFLite model.

Inspired by https://github.com/Logan1904/JuggleNet.git

## Try in your browser

## Run locally

Clone the repo and open `index.html` in Chrome or Firefox (or use a local server so the TFLite model loads correctly).

  <b>Have fun juggling and go break some personal records! ⚽️🏆</b>
